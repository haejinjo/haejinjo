ðŸ‘‹  Hi there, I'm Haejin (think like, "hedgin' your bets").

## About Me

I'm a software engineer with a passion for fullstack web development and making life easier. <br /><br />
<b>Recently worked on </b>creating a better developer experience with [Reactime](https://github.com/open-source-labs/reactime) (a DevTool for time-travel debugging Redux-less[* ](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en) React apps). So, if you want to chat, I encourage you to reach out.

<b>Always interested in</b> new tech to make for more extensible, maintainable projects and contributions. <br />
Below are my personal favorites.

## Stack

### Languages
- Javascript - quirky, lovable, prolific, very poorly named
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - a superset of Javascript and (to me) a welcome shift to static typing for the web

### Frameworks
- [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) - Ruby bootstraps
- [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) - PHP bootstraps

### Frontend
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) - Lightweight, extensible UI component library for Javascript lovers
- [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) - If you give a mouse a GraphQL API...at least give them this too

### Backend
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) - Asynchronous Javascript-based server runtime environment
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) - A thin layer to apply over Node for modular routing and more succinctly "express"ed server logic

### Testing
-  [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) - Delightfully readable and feature-rich assertion framework to create unit tests in pure isolation


## Additional Recommendations (interesting?)
Below are things I've used in my own projects and whose value I can attest to.

- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) - Structured wrapper around your app to "connect" any component to a global state (Note: use wisely)
- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) - Organize verbose boilerplate and reducers into neat "slices" and more!
- [immer](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/docs/introduction) - Skip the functional ceremony, and just mutate state directly! (but not really)
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) - Module bundler
- [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) - Clean interface for making HTTP client requests
- [Lodash](https://lodash.com/docs/) - Neat utility to boost your ability to write clean, effective JS operations
